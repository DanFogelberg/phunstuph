This minor page has been used a place for me to ~~create some art~~ practice PHP and programming think in general. It's existence is thanks to school work but I will look at it as a stepping stone to my future life with imposter syndrome. 

"This was the first project I did, connected to web development. Sweet jebus. But look how far I've come today!"
